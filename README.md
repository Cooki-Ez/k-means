# k-means
k-means (clustering) algorithm implemented in Java
--------
TASK
--------
Implement the k-means algorithm. Cluster the iris dataset in in iris.data (during clustering, ignore the decision attribute).
The program should additionally:
 Allow the user to pick k.
 After every iteration: print the sum of distances from each point from its centroid.
This value should decrease with every iteration. Note: print the total for all points,
not each cluster separately.
 At the end: print the members of each cluster.
 Optional: print measures of cluster homogeneity, eg. percentage of each iris class, or
entropy
